# network_traffice_detection

In this project we are using ISCX 2012 datasets for classification of network traffic.
Plan:
1. Download the datasets from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html
2. Convert the single pcap file to multiple pcap files based on flow
3. Seperate the network traffic data accoirding to corresponding tag (Normal, DoS, DDos, BFSSH, INI)
4. Convert each flow of pcap file to text file
5. Make the datasets ready for Few-shot based model
6. Build the model
7. Test the model 
8. Compare the performance with the latest related work
