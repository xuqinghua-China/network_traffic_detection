- Use these script to convert pcap file to text based csv file to be used for model.

To use this script, first you need to have seperated pcap file in each class. We make the seperate four folders with flow related to that class. Like for brute force 
attack, all the are store in side BFSSH, similarly for others. The converted files are store as text file in seperate folder like converted-BFSSH.
